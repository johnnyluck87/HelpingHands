## Helping Hands

## Synopsis

We want to create a hub where people can not only get help, but can also give help.
For those who need help, we can provide them with locations of the closest shelter, food bank, medical clinic, and etc...
For those who want to give help, we can provide them with a list of charity events, according to their interests, with the locations and dates.
